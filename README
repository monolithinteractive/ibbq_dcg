To run this application you must specify a twitter account. To do so, you must be running iOS5 or newer. In the settings app, add a Twitter account. iBBQ will use the first account listed in the Twitter section of the Settings app.

The application is admittedly rough since it's a demo of what can be thrown together in a Sunday afternoon. To use it:
- Set up Twitter account (see above)
- Launch the app
- See your location in the detail view (hard-coded to a location in Guelph if you're using the simulator)
- Notice the message: You're grilling ribs and ran out of beer
- Choose a liquor store on the left hand side
- Click the Twitter bird to send out a tweet asking for help with your situation
- Tweet failure is generally due to trying to tweet too often (or too soon after your last tweet), the Twitter API has restrictions on stuff like that.
